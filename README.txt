Order Of Execution:
- Importation of required Python Libraries and dataset.
- Data Cleaning Processes
- Analysis
- Recommendation

DATA CLEANING PROCESSES 

* Scanned through the documents by running some queries, below are the steps according to the cleaning process:

- Identified 16 NaN/Null values within the column 'City'. Using the Methods ".loc", and ".replace", I found - 
and replace the null values with the right values after findings were made. I also used same process to replace - 
a null value in the 'Select Investors' column with the right entry after findings were made - same for 'Funding' -
and the 'Year Founded' columns.

- Checked for duplicates; negative.

- Checked for inconsistencies in datatypes, and found that 'Year Founded' was not in a datetime format and corrected it.

- Also had to back-date a particular entry whose date was wrongly entered, using the same replacement method. 


Challenges:
1. Some of these processes was detected as errors in the middle of analysis as they weren't conspicuous. This took-
quite some time and further study to understand the errors and give the desired results.

ANALYSIS 

* A total of eight insights was carried out in this analysis:

1. Unicorn Companies with the biggest return on investment: I had to define a function to extract the numerical - 
values from the 'Funding' and 'Valuation' columns, because the entries were in a complex format. e.g '$nM'.
Afterwards I perfomed a calculation for ROI = [('Valuation' - 'Funding')/'Valuation']*100

2. Time Taken to Become a Unicorn Company: Had to convert the date columns, 'Year Founded' and 'Date Joined' to -
datetime format in order to perform operations of subtraction to arrive at desired result.

3. Fastest Companies to Achieve Unicorn Status: a continuation of the previous step, by setting attribute -
'ascending' to false, I was able to derive some insight.

4. Tech Hub Countries and Cities: Was able to drill down to the number of Unicorn companies in countries and -
cities by the use of 'value_counts()'

5. Investors who Funded The Most Unicorn: Used the same query as above

6. The Companies the Investors Invested In: as a continuation from above, I performed Bivariate analysis to reach -
my results. 

7. Investors Whos spent the Most: used a bivariate analysis for to achieve this.

8. Companies that Received Investments the Most: used a multivariate analysis to achieve this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION:

- A came to a conclusion by giving some recommmendations to the stakeholders based on the insights I derived; which -
are based on improving operations, reducing cost, analysing investments and was to optimize investments to achieve -
increased income.
